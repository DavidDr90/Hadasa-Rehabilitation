## Development server and Build

- Debug mode: Navigate to AgudaApp folder in CMD and run `ionic serve`, the browser will open automaticlly. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
- Production: Navigate to AgudaApp folder in CMD and run `ionic build --prod` (we should do it before uploading to fire base, or build android/ios product).
- Output folder will be: 'www'
- We will discuss later about create android/ios apk/ipa.
